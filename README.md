# The journey begins

I'm doing Pikuma's 2d game engine course and am going to keep this repo updated.

This initial commit is what the course starts with:

```

|-assets (all this stuff is pretty self explanatory)
|---fonts
|---images
|---scripts
|---sounds
|---tilemaps
|-libs
|---glm (math)
|---imgui (debugging gui)
|---lua (lua)
|---sol (binds lua in C++)
|-src (will include our source code)
|-Makefile (builds)
|-Readme 

```
